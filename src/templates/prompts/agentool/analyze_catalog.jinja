## Task
Analyze the task requirements and existing tool catalog to determine what needs to be built.

## Task Description
{{ task_description }}

## Existing Tool Catalog
{% if catalog %}
{{ catalog }}
{% else %}
No existing tools found in catalog.
{% endif %}

## Development Guidelines
{% if guidelines %}
{% for guideline in guidelines %}
- {{ guideline }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- Follow AgenTool framework patterns
- Use proper input/output schemas
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Include complete documentation
{% endif %}

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Parse the task description to understand what functionality is needed
   - Identify the core operations and capabilities required
   - Determine data inputs, outputs, and transformations needed
   - Consider integration points with existing tools

2. **Existing Tool Assessment**
   - Review existing tools in the catalog for reusable components
   - Identify gaps where new tools are needed
   - Determine which existing tools can be leveraged
   - Plan integration strategy with existing ecosystem

3. **System Design**
   - Create high-level architecture for the solution
   - Define tool boundaries and responsibilities  
   - Plan data flow between components
   - Consider scalability and maintainability

4. **Development Planning**
   - Break down into specific tools that need to be created
   - Prioritize tools by importance and dependencies
   - Plan implementation sequence
   - Identify testing and validation requirements

## Expected Output Format

Provide your analysis in the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "missing_tools": [
    {
      "name": "tool_name",
      "purpose": "what this tool does",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "complexity": "simple|moderate|complex",
      "dependencies": ["other_tool1", "other_tool2"],
      "key_operations": ["operation1", "operation2"]
    }
  ],
  "existing_tools": [
    {
      "name": "existing_tool_name", 
      "relevance": "how it helps with the task",
      "integration_points": ["where it connects"]
    }
  ],
  "system_design": {
    "overview": "high-level description of the solution",
    "architecture": "architectural approach",
    "data_flow": "how data moves through the system",
    "integration_strategy": "how tools work together"
  },
  "development_plan": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "action": "what to do in this step",
      "deliverable": "what gets created",
      "dependencies": ["what must be done first"]
    }
  ],
  "success": true
}
```

Focus on creating a practical, implementable plan that leverages existing tools where possible and creates new ones only where necessary.
